	I wanted to update the previous version of the blog (<a
		href="https://github.com/mdvanes/mdworld-jackson">mdworld-jackson</a
	>) based on SSG Gatsby. It was several majors behind and contained several workarounds that would
	take a lot of time to figure out, so I took it as an opportunity to move to SSG with SvelteKit.
	Shying away from runtime component libraries or CSS sets, the target is to make a package that is
	a small as possible. The Gatsby version of this blog has a speed index of 0.7. This version has a
	speed index of ...

	A secondary purpose is to learn Svelte.
